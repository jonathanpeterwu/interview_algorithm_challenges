interview_algorithm_challenges
==============================

Aggregating an open source repo to solving a list of top algorithm challenges.

Feel free to make pull requests and solve them in ruby, javascript, or a language of your choice!

TDD is encouraged.

Palantir Suggested Algorithms:
Sorting (plus searching / binary search)
Divide-and-conquer
Dynamic programming / memoization
Greediness
Recursion
Algorithms associated with a specific data structure (which brings us to our fourth suggestion…)

Some Suggestions
[link for more details](http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/)

1. String/Array/Matrix
2. Linked Lists Implementation (Stack vs Queue)
3. Tree & Heap( Binary Tree)
4. Graph - Depth first search || Breath first search (Graph Node, Queue)
5. Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insert Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
6. Recursion vs Iteration (Cool examples of solving a problem both ways)
7. Dynamic Programming technique (climbing steps problem, maximum subarray, edit distance)
8. Bit Maniupulation
9. Probability
 There are 50 people in a room, what’s the probability that two people have the same birthday? (Ignoring the fact of leap year, i.e., 365 day every year)
10. Combinations and Permutations
  Example 1:
  
  Given 5 numbers – 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, print out different sequence of the 5 numbers. 4 can not be the third one, 3 and 5 can not be adjacent. How many different combinations?
  
  Example 2:
  
  Given 5 banaba, 4 pear, and 3 apple, assuming one kind of fruit are the same, how many different combinations?
